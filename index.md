## about us

We are a team of developers who want to make open source code.
That is because the way this society handles our problems.
Take microsoft. They are ruining a game for kids by banning them for multiplayer,
just because they said a short for a a town called The kingdom of kupa keep.
Ther are ways we can stop things like that.
We can make a server type that disallows microsoft to look at messages.
It is better for both if the server owner runs the moderation, On his way.
Another way is disabling the multiplayer ban client side.
That will be our first project:
A fabric mod that disables the ban client side.
