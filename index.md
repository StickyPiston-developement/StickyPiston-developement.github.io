## about us

We are a team of developers who want to make open source code.
That is because the way this society handles our problems.
Take microsoft. They are ruining a game for kids by banning them for multiplayer,
just because they said a short for a a town called The kingdom of kupa keep.
Ther are ways we can stop things like that.
We will try to use them,
and open them for public.

A mod to stop the reports to microsoft client side and server side already exists.
It is called "No chat reports" and you can download it on [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports)
But what about the users that already are banned?
That is where we come in.
We made a mod that allows you to bypass this bans.
The mod can be found at our github projects,
with the name "No Banscreen".
You can download the [source code](https://github.com/StickyPiston-developement/no-banscreen) and compile it yourself,
or you could look at the mod [releases](https://github.com/StickyPiston-developement/no-banscreen/releases).
